# EM Meditations

A collection of Stoic meditations and reflections for Engineering Managers navigating the challenges of leadership, technology, and human dynamics.

## Why This Exists

Inspired by *[The Daily Stoic](https://dailystoic.com/)*, this is a personal experiment in connecting timeless Stoic philosophy with the daily practice of engineering management.

Each entry starts with a Stoic quote and reflects on how it relates to leadership, decision-making, and personal growth in the modern tech world.

📚 These are not lessons—they're meditations.  
🛠️ Not a manual, but a mirror.

I write them for myself. But if you're an engineering manager, a team lead, or just curious about the human side of leadership—you’re welcome here.

## Who It's For

- Engineering Managers seeking philosophical grounding
- Technical leaders exploring Stoic principles
- Anyone interested in applying ancient wisdom to modern leadership challenges
