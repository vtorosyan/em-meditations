# 001: The Freedom of No Opinion

## Today's Quote

*"We have the power to hold no opinion about a thing and to not let it upset our state of mind - for things have no natural power to shape our judgments."* - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

## The Situation

Today I was reviewing our quarterly goals and projects and realized that there were a few threads and discussions in one of the projects that I hadn't checked. Nobody was asking me to, but my "shadow" was nudging me to go and check, maybe share what I was thinking. While I trust everyone on our team to make their best effort, it still felt like I was missing out, or that I had to have an opinion about it as a manager. This created a toxic cycle where I thought I had to have an opinion just for the sake of having an opinion.

## The Challenge

How do I acknowledge that I don't have to have an opinion about everything? Moreover, how do I accept that others don't expect me to have an opinion about everything? When people don't seek my opinion, how do I know if it's because of lack of trust, my incompetence, or something else entirely?

## The Reflection

There are so many decisions and discussions that happen every minute that I'm not aware of. Since I'm not aware of them, I can't have an opinion—and I don't care about them because I literally don't know about them. I know my team really well, and I know they will come to me when they need my opinion about something. Reminding myself that there is trust and foundation in these relationships, and that I have nothing to be scared of, is really helpful.

### What I Cannot Control
- What decisions people make
- What mistakes my team might make
- What the consequences of decisions will be

### What I Can Control
- Create loops and systems to ensure I'm involved when I should be
- When to engage in conversations and when not to, avoiding micromanagement
- My own attitude and response to news I discover after the fact that I don't support

## The Practice

**Immediate Actions:**
1. When I feel the urge to check on something unprompted, pause and ask: "Is my opinion actually needed here?"
2. Remind myself that my team's autonomy is a sign of good leadership, not negligence
3. Focus on being available rather than being involved in everything
4. Trust the foundation I've built with my team - they know how to reach me

**Weekly Reflection:**
- Review which discussions I inserted myself into unnecessarily
- Notice the difference between helpful guidance and opinion-for-opinion's sake
- Celebrate moments when my team handled things without me - that's success, not failure
- Check if my "involvement systems" are working or if I need to adjust them

## The Outcome

By accepting that I don't need to have an opinion about everything, I free myself from the exhausting cycle of trying to monitor every thread and decision. This isn't about being disengaged—it's about being strategically engaged. When I stop forcing opinions where none are needed, I preserve mental energy for the decisions that truly matter and strengthen the trust my team has in their own judgment.
